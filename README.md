# Understanding the Value of Additional Data:

How much does weather data improve ridership predictions on the New York City subway?
 

## Goals

1) Predict ridership on the MTA as a regression problem using machine learning models
2) Evaluate the models' effectiveness by assessing the accuracy of the models' predictions
3) Value the information gain from adding additional data in the form of features to the models

## Technical Report
